Step 3: We now go back on first page and open page source file but there also we donâ€™t find anything useful to get user access.

Step 4: We need to check ports open on the given machine we use nmap scan
nmap -p- --open -T4 -Pn <ip addresss>

We got info that 2 ports are up one on 80 and other on 4512

Step 5: To see detail about these port we run another command
nmap -sC -sV -p80,4512 <ip addresss>
